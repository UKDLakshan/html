   <p><strong><i>Sri Lanka</i></strong> is a multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-cultural society, a reflection of the island’s encounter with successive foreign immigrants. But it all began with indigenous people, the Veddahs, hunter-gatherers who exist today.</p>
   <p>The main ethnic groups are the <strong>Sinhalese</strong> <strong>and Tamils</strong>, both originally from the Indian subcontinent. Then there are <strong>Muslims</strong>, who settled in the island from the time it became an ancient trading centre. Similarly, <strong>Malays</strong> and <strong>Chinese</strong> were also attracted to the island.</p>
